# Chernobyl_Cancer-Project-Notebook-1
This is a project I made to showcase some Python based data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization. The concept revolves around the Chernobyl nuclear disaster from 1986 in Ukraine, which I used only as a creative inspiration for a Cancer research study. I took several creative (scientific and historic) liberties to accommodate a research study scenario. But it does not have any major effects on the data analysis work or the visualization, which are the key factors to this project. 

The Jupyter notebook itself is very detailed and organized. Please take your time looking through the entire project work.

Libraries used: Numpy, matplotLib, mpl_toolkits (for 3D visualization)
